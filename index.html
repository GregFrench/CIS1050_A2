      <p class="intro">
        Japanese snacks are a worldwide phenomenon. With the vast assortment of flavours and types of snacks, people around the
        world flock to Japan to experience the tastes that you simply can&rsquo;t get anywhere else.
      </p>

      <h1 id="popular">Why are Japanese snacks so popular?</h1>

      <p>
        The reason these snacks have become so popular throughout the world is through word-of-mouth. People have either known people
        who live in Japan or have known people who have travelled to Japan and they have told them just how great the snacks are.
        This has led to those people trying it out themselves and telling their friends about it, which is what has led to the
        phenomenon it is today. Another reason Japanese snacks are so popular is the sheer amount of flavours and flavour combinations
        available to try. Some of these snacks can have flavours ranging from sweet and nutty to salty and spicy. There is truly
        something for everyone. For example, Japan in conjunction with Nestlé has produced over 300 KitKat flavour combinations over
        the past twenty years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of the Kitkat flavours include
        <ul>
          <li>Tokyo Banana KitKat</li>
          <li>Matcha Tiramisu KitKat</li>
          <li>Sakura Masamune Daiginjo Sake KitKat</li>
          <li>Cafe Latte KitKat</li>
          <li>Strawberry Cheesecake KitKat</li>
          <li>Matcha KitKat</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

      <p>
        The most popular form of KitKat on this list is the matcha KitKat. Nestlé has produced 14 different variations of the matcha
        KitKat alone. It is truly a Japanese favourite. With all of this in mind, let&rsquo;s now take a look at how you can get your
        hands on these delicious snacks.
